# ChainVid
> Built during DIF hackathon

ChainVid is a decentralized platform to store and share videos online. 


## Inspiration
With the growing demand for quality video content and the rise of decentralized platforms, we envisioned a way to empower video creators to earn from their work directly. By combining blockchain with media sharing, we wanted to build a platform where creators could monetize their content securely while giving buyers access to high-quality videos for use in their own projects. ChainVid was created to fill this gap, enabling a fair, transparent, and creator-centered video marketplace.

## What it does
ChainVid is a decentralized platform where video creators can upload and sell their work. Using smart contracts, creators are able to automatically earn revenue each time their videos are purchased. Buyers can securely access purchased content for use in their projects, with their access verified via wallet signature on our website gateway. ChainVid also features community-driven reputation scores, showcasing each creator’s success and reliability, helping buyers make informed decisions. Our platform mainly serves photostock creators and videographers, making their work accessible to content creators, filmmakers, and brands.

## How we built it
ChainVid was built on the Optimism network for efficient, low-cost transactions and utilizes Pinata for decentralized video storage. The platform’s backend is designed to handle wallet signature verification, ensuring secure access for authenticated users. Smart contracts manage the revenue split, directly rewarding creators each time a video is purchased. We implemented a reputation system to build community trust and incentivize creators to maintain high-quality content and reliable service.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was implementing secure wallet verification to ensure only authorized users could access purchased content. Integrating Pinata for efficient video storage while maintaining quick access times posed additional technical hurdles. Another challenge was designing the revenue-sharing smart contracts to be both secure and flexible enough to accommodate multiple transactions and future scaling.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud to have developed a seamless, secure platform that allows creators to monetize their work directly and effortlessly. Our reputation system adds value for buyers, giving them insights into creator reliability, and our automated revenue-sharing mechanism ensures fair, transparent payouts for creators. Launching ChainVid on the Optimism network is also a highlight, as it provides an efficient environment for decentralized media sharing.

## What we learned
Through building ChainVid, we learned the importance of balancing user experience with security, particularly when working with digital rights and content access. We also deepened our understanding of decentralized storage and blockchain-based transaction handling, and how these can be adapted to fit creative marketplaces.

## What's next for ChainVid
In the future, we plan to enhance ChainVid’s community features, including more detailed reputation metrics and creator-buyer engagement tools. We’re also exploring ways to implement customizable licensing options, allowing creators to offer a variety of usage rights. To expand our platform’s reach, we aim to onboard more creators and integrate with other creative platforms, building a larger ecosystem around ChainVid.
